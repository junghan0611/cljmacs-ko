# Navigating code

Jumping, marks, code folding and searching are effective ways of navigating a codebase, rather than using the arrow keys to move character by character or line by line.

## General Tools

Use Evil normal mode to quickly jump around your code.

| Key binding       | Description                                                                                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SPC j j`         | Search across all windows for given character(s), type highlighted character(s) to jump to location                  |
| `SPC j C`         | Jump to first unbalanced parens                                                                                      |
| `SPC j c` / `' '` | Jump to last change                                                                                                  |
| `m x` , `' x`     | Create marker called `x`, jump to marker called `x` (use any alphabet character) (see [markers section](markers.md)) |
| `#`               | Symbol highlight transient state - navigate symbol names, iedit, swoop                                               |
| `SPC s s`         | Search in current buffer, `C-j`/`C-k` to navigate results                                                            |
| `SPC s p`         | Search in project, `C-j/k` to navigate results                                                                       |


## Code Folding

Folding code hides away details, so you can just look at the function definitions and data structures of interest on the same screen.

| Key binding      | Description         |
|------------------|---------------------|
| `z` or `SPC z .` | folding code blocks |

`z` opens a menu to allow you to un/fold your code quickly.

`SPC z .` is the code fold transient menu should you wish to un/fold code many times.

See the [code folding](/navigating-code/code-folding.md) section for more details.


## Structural Editing

`SPC k` starts [lisp state structural editing](/structural-editing/).

`hjkl` to navigate the cursor across symbols and open/close parens
