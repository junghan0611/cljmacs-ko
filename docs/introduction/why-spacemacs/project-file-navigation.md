# Project and File Navigation

[Projectile](https://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){target=_blank} provides easy project management and navigation.  A project is a directory containing a version control repository, e.g. `.git` or a Clojure project, eg. `project.clj`, `pom.xml`.  A directory can be manually defined as a project by adding an empty `.projectile` file to it.

Some of Projectile's features:

* jump to a directory, file or buffer in project
* toggle between files with same names but different extensions
* toggle between code and its test
* recently visited files in the project
* switch between projects you have worked on
* kill all project buffers
* replace in project
* multi-occur in project buffers
* grep in project
* regenerate project etags or gtags (requires ggtags).
* browse dirty version controlled projects

## Treemacs

Treemacs is the default visual file browser in Spacemacs, providing a way to view and navigate all the directories and files in a project.  Visit the [Treemacs project for details of all its features](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs#detailed-feature-list){target=_blank}

++spc+"f"+"t"++ or ++spc+"p"+"t"++ toggles the Treemacs buffer, the latter opens Treemacs with the root set to the projectile project root.

++spc+0++ to select the Treemacs window at any time. The Treemacs window s always assigned the number 0.

## Ranger

++spc+a+t+r+r++ runs ranger to navigate directories and view contents of files quickly and easily, using standard Vi keybindings, ++"j"++,++"k"++,++"h"++,++"l"++.

Ranger is great for quickly looking through files, thanks to its preview option.
