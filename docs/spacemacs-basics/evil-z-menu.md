## Folding code, comments and other content
Code folding is very useful for hiding different levels of detail, for example you could hide everything but the function names in a namespace, showing just the API for that namespace.

Comments and documentation can be folded to help you focus on a specific part of the content.

| Keybinding | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `z a`      | toggle fold of code, comment, section, etc. |
| `z c`      | close fold                                  |
| `z o`      | open fold                                   |
| `z O`      | open fold recursive (capital o)             |
| `z r`      | open folds                                  |

## Scrolling
Jump the current line to the center, top or bottom of the buffer. Evil equivalents of the Emacs `C-l` key bindings.
