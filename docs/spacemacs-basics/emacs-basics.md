# Emacs Basics

Understanding the basic terminology will help make the most out of Spacemacs and allow very effective use.

| Terminology | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File        | A file on the file system                                                                                                                   |
| Buffer      | A container to display a file or other information (file navigation, REPL, data inspector, test report, etc.)                               |
| Window      | Contains a buffer, organises multiple buffers in a frame                                                                                    |
| Frame       | Holds one or more windows. Opening another frame gives you another instance of Emacs                                                        |
| Status bar  | Information about current window and buffer, e.g. window number, buffer mode & name, location of cursor. Also referred to as the mode line. |
| Mini-buffer | A command line for Emacs - shows commands and some results, acts as an interactive prompt for some commands                                 |

Spacemacs also adds [Layouts to manage a set of buffers within the scope of a project and Workspaces allow multiple window configurations](working-with-projects/layouts.md)


## Working with Frames

By default, Spacemacs opens with a frame that contains a single window, that window containing the Spacemacs home buffer.

++spc++ ++f++ ++"n"++ creates a new frame containing a single window that contains a buffer.

++spc++ ++f++ ++"d"++ closes the current frame, unless its the last Emacs frame running, then Emacs itself closes.

++spc++ ++"q"++ ++"q"++ to quit Emacs closes all frames.


## Working with windows

Each frame contains one or more windows. Each window is assigned a unique number when created, even across multiple frames.

++spc++ followed by a number jumps to the window with that number, e.g. ++spc++ ++1++ jumps to window number 1.

Windows are used to display multiple buffers (files, REPL, error messages, etc) within the same frame

| Key Binding                | Description                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| ++spc++ ++"w"++ ++period++ | Open Window transient state menu for multiple command |
| ++spc++ ++"w"++ ++2++      | 2 window layout - shows current buffer in new window  |
| ++spc++ ++"w"++ ++3++      | 3 window layout - shows current buffer in new windows |
| ++spc++ ++"w"++ ++"m"++    | maximise the current buffer                           |
| ++spc++ ++"w"++ ++"d"++    | delete current window                                 |
| ++spc++ ++"w"++ ++"g"++    | toggles golden ratio view of windows                  |


## Working with windows

A buffer is the fundamental presentation of information in Emacs.  Buffers can show the contents of a file, search results in a helm-popup, an interactive process e.g. REPL buffer, etc.

++spc++ ++tab++ toggles between the current buffer and the last active buffer

| Key Binding                | Description                                                                              |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++period++ | Open buffer transient state menu for multiple command                                    |
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++"b"++    | Show list of open buffers and recently opened buffers                                    |
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++"d"++    | Kill current buffer                                                                      |
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++"h"++    | Open Spacemacs Home buffer                                                               |
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++"m"++    | Open Spacemacs `*messages*` buffer - log of Emacs actions and commands                   |
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++"s"++    | Open Spacemacs scratch buffer - a persistent buffer for random note taking               |
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++"w"++    | Toggle read-only mode on a buffer (Spacemacs Org docs open in Read-only mode by default) |
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++"x"++    | Kill buffer and the window containing it                                                 |
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++"R"++    | Revert buffer to file saved on disk (causes .dir-locals.el to load into Emacs)           |
| ++spc++ ++"b"++ ++"Y"++    | Copy contents of a whole buffer                                                          |


## Golden Ratio

[Golden-ratio](https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el){target=_blank} automatically lays out windows in a Fibonacci style pattern.  The active window becomes the largest window and all other windows are automatically shrunk so they are out of the way, but still visible.
