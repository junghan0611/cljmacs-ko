# Ranger file manager

Ranger is a very fast and lightweight file manager that is great for previewing files without explicitly opening them.  Ranger is very well suited to Vim keybindings too.

Ranger is not part of Spacemacs by default, so the simplest way is to add the [ranger layer](http://spacemacs.org/layers/+tools/ranger/README.html).

## Add ranger layer to Spacemacs

Edit your `~./spacemacs` file and in the `...` section add the following layer

```elisp
(ranger :variables
             ranger-show-preview t
             ranger-show-hidden t
             ranger-cleanup-eagerly t
             ranger-cleanup-on-disable t
             ranger-ignored-extensions '("mkv" "flv" "iso" "mp4"))
```

This layer definition will add the ranger package and set some recommended variables:
* preview files when the cursor is on a file name in ranger
* show hidden files (dot files)
* clean up buffers when closing ranger
* file name extensions to ignore (multi-media files)
