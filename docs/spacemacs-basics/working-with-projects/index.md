# Working with Projects

Techniques to work specifically with Clojure projects as well as any concept of a project, e.g. a local git repository or using `.projectile` file to manually define a project.

Spacemacs gives you several options for managing the files in your project and you will use commands from the following menus


## File menu

Find, copy, delete, rename, sudo-edit, bookmark and browse files.

Read [Open and Create files](open-and-create-files.md) section for more details.


## Buffer menu

list, show and delete buffers.  A buffer is a container for file content and any other text and images (if images support is included in your Emacs install)

Read the [Managing Buffers](managing-buffers.md) section for more details.


## Project (Projectile) menu

find files and search/replace text in the current project (e.g. local git project or arbitrary `.projectile` defined project) and many other project specific functions.

Read the [Projectile](projectile.md) section for more details.


## Layouts

Layouts providing an easy way to group buffers together, for projects or any arbitrary grouping you decide.

Read the [Layouts and Workspaces](layouts.md) section for more details.


## File browsers / managers

[Treemacs](treemacs.md) and [Ranger](ranger.md) are file managers that help you browse through files and directories.
