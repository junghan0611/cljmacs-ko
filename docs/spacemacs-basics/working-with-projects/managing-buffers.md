# Buffer management

Buffers manage the display of files and other information. Opening a file replaces the content in the current buffer.

## Listing open buffers

`SPC b b` to select a buffer from a list of buffers

A helm pop-up window appears at the bottom listing all open buffers.  The helm popup window also shows recently opened buffers.

Using the buffer menu, `SPC b b` you can switch to any buffer currently open, especially useful for those buffers that are not currently being shown in a window.

You can also delete any of the currently open buffers when you no longer need them.


## Buffer Transient State

`SPC b .` launches buffer transient state to manage buffers using single character keybindings.

With a single key you can cycle quickly through all open buffers, forward with `n` or backwards with either `N` or `p`.

Use `d` to kill the current buffer.

## Kill buffers using buffer menu
Use helm-mini menu when you have a large number of buffers to delete.
