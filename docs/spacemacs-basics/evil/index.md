# Evil for Vim Style Editing

[Evil (extensible vi layer for Emacs) layer](https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+spacemacs/spacemacs-evil/README.html){target=_blank} provides multiple editing states, [multi-modal editing](/spacemacs/why-spacemacs/states.md), simplifying keybindings by reducing the need for simultaneous key presses.

Spacemacs provides Evil editing states and simplified keybindings throughout all layers and major modes.

![Spacemacs - Evil states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/editors/spacemacs/screenshots/spacemacs-states-vim.png)

* **normal** - for manipulating and navigating existing text (default state)
* **insert** - for writing new text
* **visual** - for selecting blocks of text
* **iedit** - edit multiple regions simultaneously
* **lisp** - structural editing for Clojure & Lisp style languages (e.g. slurp, barf)

First get familiar with **normal**, **insert** and **visual** states.  Then when you are comfortable, move on to **iedit** and **lisp** states.

!!! HINT "Normal state by default"
    Evil normal state should be used most of the time, unless writing lots of new code or text.


## Learn Vim-style editing

Vim-style editing is arguably the most effective way to work with text, supporting changes as much through text manipulation as editing text.  Once practised, vim-style editing is far faster than uni-mode editing.

The recommended way to learn vim style editing is to practice and ideally use it for everything you do.

++spc++ ++"h"++ ++t++ ++"v"++ starts the build in Vim tutorial.  This provides the basic movement of vim and provides an interactive way to practice your skills

To help make Vim style editing become a sub-conscious act you should [learn to speak Evil](../vim-style/speaking-evil.md)

[Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/){target=_blank} is a web-based game that is an alternative to practising Vim.
