# Cider Jack-in

++comma++ ++single-quote++ or ++comma++ ++"m"++ ++"s"++ (`sesman-start`) and select a `cider-jack-in` command to start a REPL process

Cider Jack-in will start a new REPL process and automatically connect to that process from the editor.

Jack-in will call either the `clojure` or `lein` command to start the REPL process, based on what project configuration files are found (`project.clj` for Leiningen and `deps.edn` for Clojure CLI) in the root of the current project. A prompt is displayed if there are multiple project configuration files to choose from.

Jack-in ensures the REPL process is started with the libraries and middleware required by CIDER.  Then the rest of the jack-in process is the same as connect, but done so automatically.


## Jack-in Configuration

++spc++ ++"u"++ ++comma++ ++"m"++ ++"s"++ opens the jack-in command in the minibuffer which can be edited to customise how the Clojure REPL process starts, e.g. adding Clojure CLI aliases to include libraries and tools for development.

Clojure CLI aliases should be added between the `-M` execution flag and the `:cider/nrepl` alias.

### Deconstructing the command line

`cider-jack-in` commands include the dependencies to start a REPL process which the Emacs Cider process can connect to, using nREPL.

`-Sdeps` adds the required library dependencies to start an nREPL server (`nrepl/nrepl`) and connect to that nREPL server from Cider (`cider/cider-nrepl`).

`:aliases` defines the `:cider/nrepl` alias, defining that the `clojure` command should run `nrepl.commandline/-main` to start an nREPL server process, along with the Cider middleware to connect to that nREPL server process


### Adding aliases

Aliases can be used from the project `deps.edn` file or the user `deps.edn` file, e.g [practicalli/clojure-deps-edn](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-deps-edn)

`:extra-paths` and `:extra-deps` configuration in aliases is used by the Cider jack-in command line.

`:main-opts` entries in aliases are ignored when `:cider/nrepl` is kept as last alias in the chain.

??? WARNING "No aliases after :cider/nrepl"
    Placing aliases after `:cider/nrepl` will prevent cider-jack-in working correctly (or at all), unless the last alias in the chain also includes the same libraries and configuration as the `:cider/nrepl` alias


## .dir-locals.el to configure REPL startup

Cider variables can be used to customize the REPL startup via a `.dir-locals.el` file in the root of the Clojure project.

`SPC p e` creates or opens a `.dir-locals.el` file in the root of the project.  A helm prompt also allows for adding entries into the file.

Add the `:env/test` alias to `cider-clojure-cli-aliases` and the paths and libraries defined aliases will always be included when running a REPL from Spacemacs

```elisp
((clojure-mode . ((cider-clojure-cli-aliases . ":env/test"))))
```

??? INFO "Add Alias names only"
    Execution flags, `-M`,`-P`,`-T`,`-X`,`-A` are automatically removed from the `cider-clojure-cli-aliases` value by the Cider jack-in code.

    The previously used variable `cider-clojure-cli-global-options` is deprecated and may cause issues with cider-jack-in that prevent the REPL from starting.

??? HINT "Custom user namespace for more REPL customisation"
    [A `user` namespace](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-cli/projects/configure-repl-startup.html){target=_blank} allows for further customisation of the REPL startup


## Multiple project configuration files

If both a `project.clj` file and a `deps.edn` file exist in the root of a project, Cider jack-in will prompt for the command to use

Use a `.dir-locals.el` file to set the command that Cider jack-in will use each time

=== "Clojure CLI"
    ```
    ((clojure-mode (cider-preferred-build-tool . clojure-cli)))
    ```

=== "Leiningen"
    ```
    ((clojure-mode (cider-preferred-build-tool . lein)))
    ```
