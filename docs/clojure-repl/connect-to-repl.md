# Connect to a Clojure REPL

Starting a REPL in a terminal is the most resilient way of running a REPL, as if the editor has to be restarted or crashes, the REPL is not affected.

[practicalli/clojure-deps-edn](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-cli/install/community-tools.html) provides many aliases to configure a REPL to work with other community tools (e.g. data ).  These aliases are easier to manage when running a REPL outside of an editor which automatically injects its own configuration.


## Start a REPL in the terminal

The `clojure` command and `clj` wrapper both start a REPL with a basic terminal interface, `clj` also provides command history.

`:repl/headless` alias from [practicalli/clojure-deps-edn](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-cli/install/community-tools.html){target=_blank} provides a rich terminal UI and libraries required for editors to connect via nREPL (network REPL protocol).

Open a terminal in the root directory of a Clojure project and run a non-interactive REPL process

```shell
clojure -M:repl/headless
```

The REPL will start along with an nREPL server, showing the connection details.

An `.nrepl-port` file is created in the root of the Clojure project, containing the port number the nREPL server is listening upon.


??? INFO "Headless terminal REPL "
    `:repl/headless` alias from [practicalli/clojure-deps-edn](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-cli/install/community-tools.html){target=_blank} includes libraries required for the nREPL connection between CIDER and the REPL.  A headless session is useful for remote REPL processes on other servers or when interaction is only done via the editor.
    ```
    clojure -M:repl/rebel-nrepl
    ```


## Connect to REPL from CIDER

++spc++ ++"f"++ ++"f"++ to open a file from the Clojure project on the remote server.

```shell
ssh remote
```

`, '` to call `sesman-start` and choose `cider-connect-clj` which should find the right host and port

Confirm the host name, typically `localhost` when running the REPL locally

Confirm the port number the nREPL server is listening too

Spacemacs is now connected to the REPL and Clojure code can be evaluated in the source code buffers.



## Common REPL start / restart keybindings

| Key bindings     | Command                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `, '` or `, m s` | start a REPL, selecting the type (`sesman-start`)                       |
| `, m b`          | browse active REPL's  (`sesman-browse`)                                 |
| `, m i`          | show information about the current REPL  (`sesman-info`)                |
| `, m q r`        | restart the REPL, quit and jack-in.  (`sesman-restart`)                 |
| `, m q q`        | quit the REPL (`sesman-quit`)                                           |
| `, e n`          | refresh stale code and load new code into the REPL (`cider-ns-refresh`) |
| `, e N`          | force reload the current namespaces in the REPL (`cider-ns-reload`)     |
