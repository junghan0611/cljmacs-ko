# Clojure LSP snippets

Clojure LSP contains several [built-in snippets](https://clojure-lsp.io/features/#snippets){target=_blank}. The [practicalli/clojure-lsp-config repository](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-lsp-config){target=_blank} enhances and extends the available snippets, helping create code that documents its purpose clearly.

## Using snippets

Start typing the name of the snippet and it should appear in the auto-completion pop-up menu.  Matching entry names end with `(Snippet)`.

## Adding custom snippets

Edit the `config.edn` file.

The `:additional-snippets` key has a collection of hash-maps, with each hash-map representing a snippet.

`$n` represents a tab-stop, where the `TAB` key will jump throughout the snippet. `n` is an integer number to define the order of the tab-stops, e.g. `$1`, `$2`, $3.

`$0` is a special tab-stop that denotes the end of the tab-stops, ending the snippet interaction.

`${n:placeholder text}` allows text to be placed at the tab-stop to give an indication as to the value to be completed.  The placeholder text is automatically highlighted when tabbing into the tab-stop, so typing a new value replaces the placeholder text.

Highlighting and replacing the text does not work for the `$0` tab-stop, so placeholder text should not be used with this specific tab-stop.
