# Source Control Introduction

Source control in Spacemacs supports Git repositories and services including GitHub, GitLab and Perforce.

Magit is a graphical Git client in Spacemacs that provides all the features of the Git command line client.

Highlight changes in file buffers and the local Git repository can be shown in the fringe.

!!! HINT "GitHub layer deprecated"
