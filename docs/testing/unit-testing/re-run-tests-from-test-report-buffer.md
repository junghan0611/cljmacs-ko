## Re-run test from  test results buffer
A test report is only generated once any of the tests fail for the current REPL session.  Once a test report has been created, further test runs will update the report.  The test report is displayed in a new buffer.

Tests can be re-run from the `*cider-test-results*` buffer, although this buffer does not support Evil normal state (PR's welcome).
