# Vim - Getting Comfortable

Getting comfortable with the Vim approach to text manipulation can take a little while.  The quickest approach is to force yourself to use Vim and stick at it until you finally go faster than you were before you started.  This can take a few days of slowness, but it is worth it, so find a few days when you are not as busy and have time to practice.
