A practical guide to Spacemacs, a community driven Emacs configuration that makes it easy to use all the power of Emacs and Vim.  The guide contains specific sections on Clojure development, although the majority of the content is applicable to any language.

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/){target=_blank} has been a shining beacon of Free and Open Source software from the early 1970's and has grown to be a versatile set of development tools for all languages.  This long history has given [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/){target=_blank} the ability to interact with almost every aspect of your digital life.

[Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/){target=_blank} is a community configuration providing a consistent and simple to learn approach to using all the features and power of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/){target=_blank}.  [Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org){target=_blank} also integrates the raw text manipulation speed of Vim and multi-modal editing into the Emacs experience, enabling you to be even more productive.

## Practicalli Spacemacs configuration

[:fontawesome-brands-github: practicalli/spacemacs-config](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config){target=_blank} contains a rich configuration for Clojure development and supporting tools, including support for Clojure LSP with minimally distracting UI elements.

=== "Free Desktop XDG Config"
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config.git $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spacemacs`
    ```
    The above command creates the `~/.config/spacemacs/init.el` that contains the configuration used in Practicalli Spacemacs book, all in one place.

=== "Classic Config"
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs-config.git $HOME/.spacemacs.d`
    ```
    The above command creates the `~/.spacemacs.d/init.el` that contains the configuration used in Practicalli Spacemacs book, all in one place.


Practicalli Spacemacs.d configuration uses a light theme and the simplified doom mode line which again can be easily changed.
