## Getting started with org

Open or create a new file with a `.org` filename extension to start org-mode major mode.

For example, if you want to write a guide to your project, you could create an org-mode file called `user-guide.org`.  When you open this file in Spacemacs, org-mode is selected as the major mode for editing.
