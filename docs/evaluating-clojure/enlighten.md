# Showing Intermediary values - Enlighten mode

As a homage to [LightTable](https://lighttable.com) live evaluation, you can enable `enlighten` minor mode to show the intermediary values during evaluation.

| Evil Normal | Description                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `, T e`     | Toggle Enlighten mode, showing intermediate values |

This provides a basic version of the [Cider inspector](inspect.md) which is always on (until you toggle it off).
